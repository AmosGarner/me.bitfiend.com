Welcome to my personal blog! Here, I will be posting opinions, presentations, and general feelings about things that I feel are too big for social media but too small to write a novel about. You might be asking yourself, why did this dude make a blog site when Social Media and Platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/) already exist?

Well, I wanted to stand up a static site that I controlled using the awesome framework known as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo allowed me to build a responsive statically generated site in only a few hours. I personally believe that we should build our own platforms to stand on. Sure, tools are nice and we don't always need to reinvent the wheel, but sometimes you need to build a wheel from scratch to understand why the wheel is the way it is.

That's why I built this site and others like it. I want to be able to rely on my own skills to build out platforms for myself and those around me who want an alternative to the already existing platforms out there. I believe in the small internet. In the Ma and Pa sites out there that wish to provide a simple service to those willing to seek them out. That's what this site means to me, and I hope, to you as well.

Thanks for Reading,

Amos
