During the CodeStock 2018 convention, I attended a talk given by [Arthur Doler](https://arthurdoler.com/) titled [What Makes You Do Stuff?](https://www.slideshare.net/arthurdoler/what-makes-you-do-stuff-the-psychology-of-motivation-codestock-2018-94464280). I really enjoyed the content presented in this talk and this is a write up of some of that content and my thoughts on it.

Arthur began by giving a brief disclaimer that he is not a professional psychologist. I would like to extend that same disclaimer about myself now.    The content found, both in this talk and in this write-up, is not meant to be taken as fact. Now, to begin with, Artur began by explaining just what he meant when he used the term "Motivation". In his own words, he provided the following slide to explain this.
