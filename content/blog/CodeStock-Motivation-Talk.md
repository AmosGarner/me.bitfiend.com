During the CodeStock 2018 convention, I attended a talk given by [Arthur Doler](https://arthurdoler.com/) titled [What Makes You Do Stuff?](https://www.slideshare.net/arthurdoler/what-makes-you-do-stuff-the-psychology-of-motivation-codestock-2018-94464280). I really enjoyed the content presented in this talk and this is a write up of some of that content and my thoughts on it.

Arthur began by giving a brief disclaimer that he is not a professional psychologist. I would like to extend that same disclaimer about myself now.    The content found, both in this talk and in this write-up, is not meant to be taken as fact. Now, to begin with, Arthur began by explaining just what he meant when he used the term "Motivation". In his own words, he provided the following slide to explain this.

During the talk, we learned that psychologist have identified 4 different versions of motivation found in humans that I will list below.

Motivation Levels
---
* 1.0 : 1 Billion BC -> 15,000 BC (Humans As Animals)
    * Hungry -> Eat
    * Thirsty -> Drink
    * Tired -> Sleep
    * Drive Theory

Version 1.0 was very basic in that we, as animals, sought out direct solutions to our needs. These needs were our motivators at the time. This is the purest form of the motivation to action relationship that we can point to and still see today in the animals around us.

* 2.0 : 15,000 BC -> 1950 CE (Humans as Machines)
    * An **Action** would be **Preformed**
    * The result would either be **Positive** or **Negative**
    * the number of times that action was performed afterward would change
    * Behaviorist theory

Version 2.0 built up humans to be more complicated, allowing them to have more motivators but simplifying the ability to motivate a human to continue behaviors that were deemed "good". If a human performed an action and was then rewarded with a negative reaction they would perform that action less and vice-versa. This is known as positive and negative reinforcement, and for the longest time was considered the main driver of understanding human behavior.

* 2.1 : 1950 AC -> 1970 AC (Humans as Androids)
    * All the great things about V2.0
    * Added the concept of Personal Achievement & Enjoyment
    * Hygiene Factor: A motivator that will eventually lose it's meaning
    * Hygiene Factors V.s. Actual Motivators
    * Hygiene Factors: Money, Safety, Security
    * Motivators: Growth, Recognition, Accomplishments

Version 2.1 built off of 2.0's platform but it added the idea of hygiene factors and actual motivators like **personal achievement** and task **enjoyment**. This new outlook on the human psychology allowed a more flexible view into the motivators of humankind. However...

## These Versions Are All Wrong

---

Based on a whole bunch of scientific experiments in the field of psychology during the late 70's (there in the presentation if you care to look them up) it was found that there were basically two types of personalities out there. Each person is able to change from one personality to the other and you can be one type about one subject while simultaneously being the other personality type on another subject. This new personality version was called...

* 3.0 : 1970 CE ~ Present (Humans as Humans)
    * Extrinsic Motivation
        * Algorithmic Behavior
    * Intrinsic Motivation
        * Heuristic Behavior
    * Humans are natural rule benders
    * Type I and Type X Personalities

<img class="ui large image" alt="Drive Theory Illustration" src="/resources/blog/CodeStock-Motivation-Talk/3.0.png" />


This new research revealed that people were either motivated by Intrinsic motivators such as personal achievement or extrinsic motivators like money. These people were broken up into two groups, Type I people, and Type X.

* Type I
    * Motivation 3.0
    * Performs best in the Long Run
    * Self Motivating
    * Money is usually a Hygiene Factor
    * Internally Focused

* Type X
    * Motivation 2.0
    * Performs best in the Short Run
    * Capable of Burnout
    * Money is usually the end goal
    * Externally Focused


It also turns out that humans have the amazing ability to change what type of person they are. Arthur's presentation also went on to point out that several companies hire specifically the personality type that is most prevalent in their company. This is interesting because the quickest way to change a type I person into a type X is to put them in a group with a large number of type Xs and vice-versa.

This may sound familiar to you if you have heard the theory that intelligence is made and not born. It is theorized that a person's ability to become more intelligence is greatly influenced by their belief in this concept. This philosophy is well presented in this [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W47rcJowx7k) by [Linda Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Rising) where she spends a great deal of time talking about intelligence and if you're born with it or if it's a muscle that can be trained.

Ultimately though the point that I'm trying to get across is that it struck me, during Arthur's presentation, that these incredible different people came to the same general point while discussing completely different domains. If you ever get a chance to see these two speakers then I highly recommend taking the opportunity. To me, it illustrates that maybe nothing in this world is a constant. We should challenge ourselves to identify the type X and type I inside us and work towards finding value in all the things we do in life. In closing, I leave you with this.
