During the CodeStock 2018 convention, I attended a talk given by [Arthur Doler](https://arthurdoler.com/) titled [What Makes You Do Stuff?](https://www.slideshare.net/arthurdoler/what-makes-you-do-stuff-the-psychology-of-motivation-codestock-2018-94464280). I really enjoyed the content presented in this talk and this is a write up of some of that content and my thoughts on it.

Arthur began by giving a brief disclaimer that he is not a professional psychologist. I would like to extend that same disclaimer about myself now.    The content found, both in this talk and in this write-up, is not meant to be taken as fact. Now, to begin with, Arthur began by explaining just what he meant when he used the term "Motivation". In his own words, he provided the following slide to explain this. ![Motivation Explanation Slide](/resources/blog/Codestock-Motivation-Talk/Motivation_SS_1.png)



During the talk, we learned that psychologist have identified 4 different versions of motivation found in humans that I will list below.

Motivation Levels

* 1.0 : 1 Billion BC -> 15,000 BC (Humans As Animals)
	* Hungry -> Eat
	* Thirsty -> Drink
	* Tired -> Sleep
    * Drive Theory

Version 1.0 was very basic in that we, as animals, sought out direct solutions to our needs. These needs were our motivators at the time. This is the purest form of the motivation to action relationship that we can point to and still see today in the animals around us.

* 2.0 : 15,000 BC -> 1950 CE (Humans as Machines)
    * An **Action** would be **Preformed**
    * The result would either be **Positive** or **Negative**
    * the amount of times that action was preformed afterwards would change
    * Behaviorist theory

Version 2.0 built up humans to be more complicated, allowing them to have more motivators but simplifying the ability to motivate a human to continue behaviors that were deemed "good". If a human preformed an action and was then rewarded with a negative reaction they would preform that action less and vice-versa. This is know as positive and negative reinforcement, and for the longest time was considered the main driver behind understanding human behavior.

* 2.1 : 1950 AC -> 1970 AC (Humans as Androids)
    * All the great things about V2.0
    * Added the concept of Personal Achievement & Enjoyment
    * Hygiene Factor: A motivator that will eventually lose it's meaning
    * Hygiene Factors V.s. Actual Motivators
    * Hygiene Factors: Money, Safety, Security
    * Motivators: Growth, Recognition, Accomplishments

* 3.0 :
