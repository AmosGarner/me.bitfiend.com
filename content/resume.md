# Testimonials
## [Joshua Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-jones-23073558/): Manager (RSC)
I managed Amos at a time of critical change in Radio Systems, during a web re-platform effort. Amos is a passionate developer who cares, not only about his product, but especially about who is on the other end of that product. Amos was willing to stand up for what he believed in and raised his hand when he felt like we weren't working out a solution for the customer's competitive advantage.

As a developer, Amos started out needing some growth in his skills, but his team of developers, as well as myself, quickly noticed his willingness to pick up the pace and learn on the fly. Amos did the homework he needed to get caught up, reached out when he needed help, and added his skills to the team. Before we knew it, he was adding ideas, innovation, and skills that we didn't have. Amos would add a diverse and flexible skill set to any team he will work with.

Amos has a passion for continually improving and pushing his skills forward. He takes a very methodical approach to solving problems and doesn't hesitate to seek feedback from teammates. He learns from others experiences and applies that knowledge in his own work. Amos is tenacious and doesn't let failure keep him from accomplishing his goals.
